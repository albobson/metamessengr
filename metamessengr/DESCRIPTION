Description: This package allows one to analyze downloaded Facebook Messenger data. It is currently in development and more tools are planned to be added in the future. As it stands, there are tools to select and clean the message data, and then to perform basic summaries. Additionally, there are tools to add sentiment scores for each word in the messages, and statistical and plotting functions to analyze the sentiment of the data. Let us know if you have any suggestions!
