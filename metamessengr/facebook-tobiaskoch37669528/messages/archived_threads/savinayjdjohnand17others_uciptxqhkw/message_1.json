It would require two weeks for travel to and from the US and within India. \nRound trip flights run around $1500 and in country expenses would also be around $1500 for budget accommodations and travel. Throw in another $500 for visas and misc costs and you're looking at somewhere around $3500. It would require a fair amount of planning, so we'd be looking at 2020-2021. \n\nI know that the time and expense would be difficult for many of you to swing, but I wanted to at least through out the idea. \nIF this is something you are potentially interested in, let me know and we'll continue discussions. \nOf course, I'd be open to people bringing along friends, spouses or older children (14+). You'd need to be in decent physical fitness to come (be able to run a 5k in 30 min). \nIf this is something that might interest you, send me a pm. I'm not looking for commitments now, just interest. Feel free to leave the group if this isn't something you are interested in. \nCheers!",
